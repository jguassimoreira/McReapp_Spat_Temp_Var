segment_struct.py - segments each subject's T1 (high res anatomical) image into gray matter, white matter, CSF. Used for supplementary analyses

gm_gather_analyze.R - first part compiles each subject's gray matter data into a single dataset; second part analyzes association between gray matter density and variability estimates

Perhaps not ideally, other scripts along with data are located exclusively on this paper's osf page (https://osf.io/42fkx/)
